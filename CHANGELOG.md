This project *does not* adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), as it is an end-user game, not a library.
Here:

* The major is for huge changes, e.g. major rewrites (e.g. 1.x would is [Quantum Game with Photons (2014-2016)](https://github.com/stared/quantum-game)).
* The minor is for major releases (kind of more subjective).
* Each match version is any release on [quantumgame.io](https://quantumgame.io/) that might have some backward-incompatible changes.
