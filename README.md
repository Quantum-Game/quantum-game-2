## TODO:

### GAME:
### GRID
- [ ] have the elements not leak the attributes
- [ ] make the grid responsive by passing the tile-size prop on resize
- [ ] Polarizer functiobality
- [ ] Speech Bubble

after talk:
- [ ] photon dispersing animation
- [ ] key concepts
- [ ] make levels same size?

### GOALS METER
- [ ] our own implementation

### EXPLANATION
- reimplement activeCell logic


### YOUR PHOTON(S)

### ENCYCLOPEDIAs
- [ ] add inline styling for images
- [ ] add aria attributes for folded panes

### MAINTENANCE

### BUGS
- [ ] entry seciton scrollHeight bug, where the open entry section max height is ill-calculated, resulting in the text not fitting in. Might be correlated to flex / screen width;
