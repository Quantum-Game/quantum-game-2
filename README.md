Quantum Game is currently being developed by dr [Piotr Migda≈Ç](http://p.migdal.pl/), [Philippe Cochin](https://github.com/sneakyweasel), [Chiara Decaroli](https://maperseguirvirtute.wordpress.com/), [Klem Jankiewicz](http://jankiewiczstudio.com/), [Kuba Strebeyko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/strebeyko/) and others.

This version of the game was funded by the [Center for Quantum Technologies of the National University of Singapore](https://www.quantumlah.org/).

The current version uses [Quantum Tensors](https://github.com/stared/quantum-tensors) - a JavaScript / TypeScript package for sparse tensor operations on complex numbers. It is a NPM package we created for this game, but made it in a way it is reusable.

You can play the old version [here](http://play.quantumgame.io/); its source is at [stared/quantum-game](https://github.com/stared/quantum-game).
