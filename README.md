Quantum Game is currently being developed by dr [Piotr Migdał](https://p.migdal.pl/), [Philippe Cochin](https://github.com/sneakyweasel), [Chiara Decaroli](https://maperseguirvirtute.wordpress.com/), [Klem Jankiewicz](http://jankiewiczstudio.com/), [Kuba Strebeyko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/strebeyko/), [Pawel Janicki](https://www.paweljanicki.jp/) and others.

This version of the game was funded by the [Center for Quantum Technologies of the National University of Singapore](https://www.quantumlah.org/).

The current version uses subcomponents:

* [Quantum Tensors](https://github.com/Quantum-Game/quantum-tensors) - a JavaScript / TypeScript package for sparse tensor operations on complex numbers. It is an NPM package we created for this game, but made it in a way it is reusable.
* [bra-ket-vue](https://github.com/Quantum-Game/bra-ket-vue) - quantum state and operator visualizer, in Vue.js.
* [Quantum Encyclopedia](https://github.com/Quantum-Game/qg-encyclopedia) - encyclopedia of elements and concepts in quantum physics.

You can play the old version (2014-2016) [here](http://play.quantumgame.io/); its source is at [stared/quantum-game](https://github.com/stared/quantum-game).
