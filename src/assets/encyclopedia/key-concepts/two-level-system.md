# Two-level system

The simplest quantum system, it has only two quantum states, which can be in a superposition.

## The basics

There are different physical implementations of a two level system. Usually any property that has two values can be used, such as, for example “open” and “closed”. Depending on the physical system chosen, the two “levels” or “states” are different. For example, for electrons, the two level is often encoded in the spin state. The electron can either be in state spin up or spin down and these two states can be in a superposition. For light, these are usually polarization states (vertical and horizontal polarization).

## Digging Deeper

Two level systems are an approximation or real system which usually consists of many more than two levels. One famous two level system is the Qubit!

Quantum systems are fragile and difficult to control, and scientists encode qubits in many different physical systems, each of whom has its pros and cons. Examples of qubits include:

| Physical system | Qubit state &#124;0> | Qubit state &#124;1>
|-----------------|----------------------|--------------------
| Electron | Electron spin up | Electron spin down
| Atom or ion | Valence electron on in ground-state orbital | Valence electron excited to a higher orbital
| Photon | Horizontal polarisation | Vertical polarisation
| Transmon (superconducting qubit) | Electrical current flowing clockwise in a loop | Electrical current flowing counter-clockwise in a loop
