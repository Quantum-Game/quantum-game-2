# Polarization

Polarization is the direction of oscillation of an electromagnetic wave.

## The basics

There are many types of polarization! The wave can oscillate up and down (this is then called a vertically polarised wave), right and left (a horizontally polarized wave), in a circle (circularly polarised) and a combination of these (elliptically polarised and light polarised at a specific angle, for example at 45 degrees).
Can we create an arbitrary polarization? Yes! There are special materials which select just one kind of polarization, they are called polarisers or polarization filters. So we can start with unpolarised light, which is light made up of all kinds of polarization, and let it go though one of these polarisers to end up with only vertical, or only circular polarization. 

## Digging Deeper

TLetâ€™s take a look at some everyday objects which make use of polarization!
The obvious one are **sunglasses**! First of all, we must now that nonmetallic surfaces such as asphalt roadways, snowfields and water, reflect light such that there is a large concentration of vibrations in a plane parallel to the reflecting surface. A person viewing objects by means of light reflected off of nonmetallic surfaces will often perceive a glare if the extent of polarization is large. 
Polarized sunglasses are nothing but polarization filters, blocking off the polarization parallel to the plane of reflection (which for a road, or the water of a lake is horizontal) they reduce the glare! 
Another example is **glasses used to watch 3D movies**. Here, the viewer wears glasses such that to each eye only one kind of polarization is sent. This way each eye receives its own image, and as the two images are slightly different, they create a stereoscopic view which gives rise to a 3D image.
