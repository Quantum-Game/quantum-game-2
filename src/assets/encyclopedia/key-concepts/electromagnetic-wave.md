# Electromagnetic wave

## The basics

Electromagnetic waves are all around us, it’s thanks to them that most of our domestic appliances work, from our smartphones to our microwaves and computers. And light, any sort of light, light from the sun and light from a lightbulb, lights that you attach to your bike and laser light from your pointer, is an electromagnetic wave.

Electromagnetic waves are waves which are made of two components, the electric field (E) and the magnetic field (B) component. These two are orthogonal to each other (i.e. they are at 90 degrees to each other). An electromagnetic wave is much like a water wave, it moves up and down in a regular fashion. However, the special thing of electromagnetic waves is that they are *transverse waves*.

Transverse waves are special in the fact that the direction of propagation of the wave is orthogonal to the direction of the oscillation. Let’s come back to the sea wave, the waves are travelling towards the shore, however if we are in the water at a specific position, we are moving up and down and the wave rises and lowers, so the oscillation direction is vertical! This is also how electromagnetic waves work, and therefore also light.

So, to recap, light is an electromagnetic wave, this is a special type of wave, called transverse wave, because the direction of propagation of the wave is orthogonal to the direction of oscillation of the electric field. 

## Digging deeper

How else can we describe these waves? There are a few parameters which we use to differentiate waves:
1. amplitude: describes how big is a wave. A big wave will have a large amplitude. When the sea is stormy, the waves are high, they have a large amplitude.
2. intensity: is related to the amplitude. If a wave has a large amplitude, it will be very intense. When the sun is very bright, it is very intense. This means all the rays that come from it are reaching us. If it’s cloudy, the rays hit the clouds and are scattered in all directions, so less rays reach our eyes. 
3. phase: this is a quantity that helps us to locate a wave in space. Usually we need a point of reference to then identify the phase. For example, when we have two identical waves, if we delay one with respect of the other, we are changing the phase. Different waves can be in phase, when the oscillations are the same at the same points in time, or out of phase, when one wave is oscillating upwards and one downwards at the same time. In this case, there is a phase difference between them of 180 degrees.
4. wavelength: it is the distance between two peaks of a wave. Each wave has its own wavelength. Visible light that comes from the sun is made up of rays with different wavelengths. When we see a rainbow we see all the individual colours. To each colour corresponds a different wavelength. However, visible light is only a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum! Most of the EM waves are invisible to us!
5. frequency: it is related to the wavelength and to the speed of light. Each wave has its own frequency. It is also related to the energy of the wave.
6. power: tells us how much intensity is present in a second. In the supermarket, we can find lightbulbs with different powers. Some create a brighter light, others a dimmer light.
