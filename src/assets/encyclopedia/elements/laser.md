# Single Photon Source

An on-demand single photon source. (CLICK to EMIT!)

## The basics

Single photon sources allow the production of individual photons. The single photons have characteristic quantum behaviour. Single photons were created only quite recently, in the 1970s! They are the “quantum”, or the smallest unit, of electromagnetic field!

## Digging deeper

In most cases, there is a system which emits a single photon upon a certain process. Some systems which can produce single photons are trapped ions, attenuated beams of sodium atoms, pentacene molecules and more recently nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond, quantum dots and two dimensional materials.

One of the processes through which single photons can be created is parametric down conversion. In this process a single photon which interacts with a non linear crystal can be split into two photons, and vice versa.

## USAGE IN THE LABORATORIES

Single photons are routinely used in quantum information laboratories, They are the main characters of Bell test experiments and quantum cryptography!
