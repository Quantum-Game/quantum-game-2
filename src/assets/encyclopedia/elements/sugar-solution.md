## The basics

Sugar molecules are chiral, meaning they differ from their mirror image. Chiral molecules affect right- and left-circularly polarized light differently. As a consequence, they can be used to rotate polarization.

All glucose found in nature is “D-glucose”. “L-Glucose” is its mirror image, which can be synthesised in the laboratory but does not occur naturally. Scientists can distinguish the two by measuring which direction they rotate polarization.

## Digging deeper

Sugar solution rotates polarization due to birefringence. The left- and right-circular polarization experience different phase velocities, and so acquire a phase-shift as they travel through the solution. By choosing the thickness of the solution correctly, we can affect the polarization in a controlled manner.

Suppose a photon travels through a sugar solution, gets reflected off the mirror, and travels back through the solution. On the second pass, the effect of the sugar solution is reversed, and the photon comes back with the same polarization it started with. The reason for this is that upon reflection, the wave changes chirality - so left-circularly polarized light becomes right-circularly polarized, and vice versa. However, the way sugar solution acts on a photon is independent of which direction the photon is coming from, since the interaction only depends on sugar chirality.

## Usage in laboratories and experiments

Scientists usually prefer to drink sugary drinks rather than use them in experiments.
