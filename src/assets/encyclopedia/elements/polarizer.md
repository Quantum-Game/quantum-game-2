# Polarizer

Filters light of a specific polarization, while blocking light of all other polarisations.
It can transform mixed polarised light into light of a specific polarization.

## The basics

Polarizers are made of crystals which are dichroic, they prefer to absorb light which is polarised in a particular direction. Wire-grid polarizers let through the polarization which is parallel to the grid direction, as shown below.

## Usage in everyday life

Polarizers are all around us, from our sunglasses to our cameras. Sunlight which is reflected off surfaces is often polarized, and by blocking out some of the polarized light these filters attenuate the overall amount of light that reaches our eyes or the camera sensors. In photography, a polarizer can be used to change the contrast of a picture!

## Usage in the Laboratory

Polarizers are everywhere in Optics and Quantum physics labs! Can you spot them below?
