# Non-linear Crystal

Can create 2 photons from a single photon, the two photons have half the frequency of the original photon. Conversely, can combine two photons to create a single photon with double the frequency.

## The Basics

Non linear optics is a special type of optics which works a bit differently than linear optics (examples of which are mirrors, beamsplitters, attenuators). It allows us to change the color of a light beam, to change its shape in space and time, and to create the shortest events ever made by humans. There are many different phenomena that can occur because of non linear behaviour, some examples are:

* Second-harmonic generation: combines two photons into one with double frequency
* Sum-frequency generation: combines two photons into one with frequency as the sum of the incoming photons frequencies.
* Spontaneous parametric down-conversion use to create single photon sources!

To create a non linear effect, a non linear medium is placed in the path of light. Usually a non linear crystal is used, such as the BBO crystal.

## Usage in everyday life and the laboratory

Non linear crystals are used for research applications in optical communication, optical sensing and materials research.

## Digginf Deeper

BBO, or Barium Borate crystals are very common medium used to create non linear phenomena. They are strongly birefringent, meaning that they have two different refractive indices. In addition, they have a specific crystal symmetry and are resistant to high power light. Other types of non linear crystals are KDP (potassium dihydrogen phosphate), KTP (potassium titanyl phosphate), and lithium niobate.

Spontaneous parametric down conversion using a non linear crystal can generate two photons with entangled polarisation!
