# Photon Detector

It detects any photon which is incident on it by transforming it into an electrical signal.

## Basics

Some people argue that us humans, if we really stretch our eyes, can detect even single photons. [“The most amazing thing is that it’s not like seeing light. It’s almost a feeling, at the threshold of imagination”](https://www.nature.com/news/people-can-sense-single-photons-1.20282). Catching a single photon is an enormous challenge! Luckily, scientists have worked for us and have come up with many devices which can sense as little as one photon!

One of the most common single photon detectors is a called a photomultiplier tube. This is a device which can translate photons, which are light, into electricity, which can be measured precisely.

## Everyday use

Hardly any of us needs such a device on our everyday life, there is generally way too much light around us for us to be able to see single photons. However, single photon detectors are heavily used in quantum physics laboratory! And, of course, in quantum physics games! On the other hand, we find devices which turn light into electricity all around us, for example that’s exactly what solar panels do!

## Digging deeper

How does a photomultiplier tube work?
These devices are a tube filled with vacuum. Inside, the photons hit a cathode, where, by the photoelectric effect, they are transformed into electrons.
The electrons are then guided down along the tube and, as they hit other electrons, they create more and more electrons. The original electron from the photon is multiplied to create a flow of electrons, or a current, high enough to be measured precisely.

Photomultiplier tubes, also called PMTs, can multiply the original current by 100 million times!

Photomultiplier tubes have been the first “electrical eye”, and to date are one of the most used devices to count photons. And the fact that we can count photons is yet again a demonstration that Einstein was right, light is not only a wave but also a quantized particle!!

## Usage in Laboratories

PMTs, along with other types of photon counting detectors, such as photochemical and thermal detectors, are widely used in physics laboratories. In many quantum physics experiments, we need to be able to count the emitted photons. And they are also used to detect very faint signals, for example from passing neutrinos, such as at the superkamiokande experiment, which is a huge underground chamber filled with water and entirely covered in PMTs!
