# Acusto-Optic Modulator

Using sound, it shifts the frequency of light by a certain amount.

## The basics

Acusto-optic modulators are made up of a piece of glass to which a piezoelectric transducer is attached. The transducer generates an acoustic wave which propagates through the glass. The sound waves travelling through the crystal change periodically its refractive index. An incoming beam of light scatters off from the period refractive index planes, producing many different beams with shifted frequencies (different orders).

## Usage in everyday life

It is likely that your laser printer has an AOM embedded into it, to modulate the power of a laser beam.

## Usage in laboratories

AOMs are used in setups which control certain laser properties, and maintain light stable over a long time.

## Digging Deeper

AOMs usually operate under the Bragg condition. They can be used to modulate different properties of the incoming light beam:

* orders of diffraction: a number of different beams can be created
* intensity: depending on the intensity of the sound wave, the intensity of light in the diffracted beams can be modified
* frequency: a consequence of the moving sound waves is that different diffracted beams are shifted in frequency
* phase: the diffracted beam phase is shifted by the sound wave phase
* polarization
