This is because all the light gets reflected inside the glass of water, none is transmitted to the outside. However, if you hold the glass with your fingers, by holding it tightly you will see your fingerprints appearing</p><p>Beamsplitters are used in interferometers, and some spooky phenomenon can be achieved with them (check out level xx)! This phenomenon is due to a phase shift which the beamsplitter imparts on the reflected beam. When light bounces off a material with a higher refractive index, it picks up a phase of 180°, or a π-phase.</p>"
