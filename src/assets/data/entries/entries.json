However, if you hold the glass with your fingers, by holding it tightly you will see your fingerprints appearing</p><p>Beamsplitters are used in interferometers, and some spooky phenomenon can be achieved with them (check out level xx)! This phenomenon is due to a phase shift which the beamsplitter imparts on the reflected beam. When light bounces off a material with a higher refractive index, it picks up a phase of 180°, or a π-phase.</p>"

It allows us to change the color of a light beam, to change its shape in space and time, and to create the shortest events ever made by humans. There are many different phenomena that can occur because of non linear behaviour, some examples are:</p><ul><li>Second-harmonic generation: combines two photons into one with double frequency</li><li>Sum-frequency generation: combines two photons into one with frequency as the sum of the incoming photons frequencies.</li><li>Spontaneous parametric down-conversion use to create single photon sources!</li></ul><p>To create a non linear effect, a non linear medium is placed in the path of light. Usually a non linear crystal is used, such as the BBO crystal.</p>"
