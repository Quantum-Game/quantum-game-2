If the two outgoing beams have the same intensity, it is called a 50-50 beamsplitter. This ratio between the two beams intensity can be tuned arbitrarily to obtain more light transmitted than reflected or vice versa. Beamsplitters can also be used in reverse, to recombine two beams into one!"

If you look down into your glass of water, you will notice that you can’t see the “outside world” at all through the sides of the glass. This is because all the light gets reflected inside the glass of water, none is transmitted to the outside.
