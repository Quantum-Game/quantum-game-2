The left- and right-circular polarization experience different phase velocities, and so acquire a phase-shift as they travel through the solution. By choosing the thickness of the solution correctly, we can affect the polarization in a controlled manner.</p><p>Suppose a photon travels through a sugar solution, gets reflected off the mirror, and travels back through the solution. On the second pass, the effect of the sugar solution is reversed, and the photon comes back with the same polarization it started with. The reason for this is that upon reflection, the wave changes chirality - so left-circularly polarized light becomes right-circularly polarized, and vice versa. However, the way sugar solution acts on a photon is independent of which direction the photon is coming from, since the interaction only depends on sugar chirality.</p>"
