However, if you hold the glass with your fingers, by holding it tightly you will see your fingerprints appearing</p><p>Beamsplitters are used in interferometers, and some spooky phenomenona can be achieved with them (check out level 6)! This phenomenon is due to a phase shift which the beamsplitter imparts on the reflected beam. When light bounces off material with a higher refractive index, it picks up a phase of 180°, or a π-phase.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Quantum-Game/qg-encyclopedia/master/imgs/beam_splitter.jpg\" alt=\"Beamsplitter\"></p>"
