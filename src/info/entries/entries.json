If the two outgoing beams have the same intensity, it is called a 50-50 beamsplitter. This ratio between the two beams intensity can be tuned arbitrarily to obtain more light transmitted than reflected or vice versa. Beamsplitters can also be used in reverse, to recombine two beams into one!"

This ratio depends on the gap between the two prisms, which is chosen and manufactured extremely carefully.</p><p>[You can experiment with frustrated total internal reflection yourself by filling a glass with water. If you look down into your glass of water, you will notice that you can’t see the “outside world” at all through the sides of the glass. This is because all the light gets reflected inside the glass of water, none is transmitted to the outside. However, if you hold the glass with your fingers, by holding it tightly you will see your fingerprints appearing"
